# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques such as DBSCAN, KMeans, and hierarchical clustering. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customer base better, target marketing efforts effectively, and tailor products or services to specific segments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers including their demographics, purchasing history, and other relevant features. The dataset can be found in the `Mall_Customers.csv`. 

## Clustering Techniques

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed. It is particularly useful for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise in the data.

### KMeans

KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance. It is simple and efficient, making it one of the most popular clustering algorithms.

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters, also known as a dendrogram, by recursively merging or splitting clusters based on a distance metric. It does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis.

## Results

The results of the clustering analysis will be presented in the Jupyter notebook along with visualizations to aid interpretation. The identified customer segments can be further analyzed to formulate targeted marketing strategies or personalized recommendations.
